### What are we going to learn:
 - Python3 
 - Math behind computer vision and object detection
 - OpenCV
 - Tensorflow
 
 ---

### Prerequisites
 - Python3 basic knowledge

### System requirements
 - Highly recommend to use unix operating system (Linux, macOs)
 - python3 installed

### System configuration
```bash
git clone https://github.com/twrdyyy/bit_computer_vision.git
cd bit_computer_vision
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If everything configured correctly run
```bash
python3 -c "import numpy; import cv2; import tensorflow; import matplotlib; print('ok')"
```
